### Hi there!

I am Anke and I am currently learning Python. I follow an online "100-days-of-code"-course and am using GitHub to organize and share my solutions to the coding exercises. 

I am also working on a little math training program for my daughter so that she can practice her multiplication tables: "Mathetrainer". Partly in German.
